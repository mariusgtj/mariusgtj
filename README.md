- 👋 Hi, I’m @mariusgtj
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming web developer.
- 🌱 I started at +40, so I try to learn as much as I can beside my day-to-day job. I have the basic skills for the frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and the 
backend (PHP). I'm working at few projects concerning web applications and websites.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people from my age who want to learn or develop projects on web technologies.
- 📫 How to reach me: gatejmarius@gmail.com.
